# Windows App Deprecation

The original MakeCode for micro:bit Windows app has been deprecated. For continued support, please use our new app: https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-makecode-for-microbit/9NMQDQ2XZKWK

## Moving Projects

If you want to keep the projects you saved with the old app and use them again in the new app, you will need to transfer them.

1. Share the project from the app using the **Share** option.
2. Copy the shared project URL that the app gives you.
3. On the new MakeCode app homepage, click on **Import** to open the shared project with the URL you just copied.
