Create a counter with a while loop.

## ~avatar avatar

Welcome! This tutorial will teach how to create a counter with a while loop. Let's get started!

## ~

Create a variable that acts as a counter and set it to `0`.

```blocks
let count = 0
```

Add a while loop that will loop over and over until the variable ``||variables:count||`` equals `10`.

```blocks
let count = 0
while (count < 10) {

}
```

Let's add a pause. Then show the value of ``||variables:count||``.

```blocks
let count = 0;
while (count < 10) {
    basic.pause(100);
    basic.showNumber(count)
}
```

Increase the value of ``||variables:count||`` by one.

```blocks
let count = 0
while (count < 10) {
    basic.pause(100)
     basic.showNumber(count)
    count = count + 1
}
```
