Answer the questions while completing the tutorial. Pay attention to the dialogues!

## 1. What is the meaning of the term 'collection' in programming? What is a 'collection' of strings?

<br/>

A 'collection' is a group of variables of the same type stored together. A 'collection' of strings is a group of strings stored together.

## 2. Consider the following lines of code.

```blocks
let coll: string[] = []
coll.push("puppy")
coll.push("clock")
```

Write the line of code that will display the string "puppy" using ``||variables:coll||``.

<br/>

```blocks
let coll: string[] = []
basic.showString(coll[0])
```

## 3. Consider the following lines of code.

```blocks
let coll: string[] = []
coll.push("puppy")
coll.push("clock")
coll.push("cat")
```

Write the line of code that will display the string "cat" using ``||variables:coll||``.

<br/>

```blocks
let coll: string[] = []
basic.showString(coll[2])
```

## 4. Consider the following line of code.

```blocks
let coll: string[] = []
```

Write the five (5) lines of code that will add the following five words to ``||variables:coll||``: `"puppy"`, `"clock"`, `"night"`, `"cat"`, and `"cow"`.

<br/>

```blocks
let coll: string[] = []
coll.push("puppy")
coll.push("clock")
coll.push("night")
coll.push("cat")
coll.push("cow")
```

## 5. Write the code to get a string from the collection at a random position.

<br/>

```blocks
let coll: string[] = []
let index = randint(0, coll.length)
let word = coll[index]
```
