## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to get the **acceleration**, `acceleration` in one of three specified dimensions. We will be learning how to get the acceleration using a forever loop, local variables, input on button pressed, as well as simple commands, such as show number and pause.

## Documentation

```cards
basic.forever(() => {
})
let x = 0
input.acceleration(Dimension.X)
if (true) {
}
input.buttonIsPressed(Button.A)
basic.showNumber(0)
```

## Objectives

* learn how to repeat code in the background forever
* learn how to create a variable to store data
* learn how to get the acceleration value (g-force), in one of three specified dimensions
* learn how to pause your code for the specified number of milliseconds
* learn how to conditionally run code depending on whether a condition is true or not
* learn how to get the state of an input button
* learn how to show a number on the LED screen
