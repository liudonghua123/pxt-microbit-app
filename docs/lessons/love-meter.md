## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to use the **pin pressed**, `on pin pressed` to run code when the user holds the GND pin with one hand, and presses pin 0 with the other hand, thus completing a circuit. We will be learning how to create a love meter using input on pin pressed, a local variable, math random, If (conditional) as well as simple commands, such as show number, pause, and show string.
