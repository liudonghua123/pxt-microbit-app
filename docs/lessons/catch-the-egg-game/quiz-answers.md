let basketX = 2
let eggX = 2
let eggY = 0
led.plot(eggX, eggY)
led.plot(basketX, 4)
```

## 3. Write the three lines of code that moves the egg down. (You need to unplot the egg's current position, update its position variables, and plot its new position.

<br/>

```blocks
let basketX = 2
let eggX = 2
let eggY = 0
led.unplot(eggX, eggY)
eggY = eggY + 1
led.plot(eggX, eggY)
```

## 4. . Write the code that resets the egg after it has fallen past the bottom of the @boardname@.

<br/>

```blocks
let eggX = 2
let eggY = 0
if (eggY > 4) {
    eggY = -1
    eggX = randint(0, 5)
}
```
