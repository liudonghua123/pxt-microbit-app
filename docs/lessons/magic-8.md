## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to creating **conditionals**, `if condition do` to conditionally run code depending on whether a condition is true or not. We will be learning how to create a fortune telling app using local variable and conditionals (If), input on shake as well as simple commands, such as show string, show number, and clear screen.
