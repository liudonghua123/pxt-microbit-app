Learn how to get the ambient temperature (degree Celsius °C). The temperature is inferred from the the surface temperature of the various chips on the @boardname@. We will be learning how to get the temperature using on shake, local variables, as well as simple commands such as show number.

## Documentation

```cards
input.temperature()
let x = 0
basic.showNumber(7)
basic.showString("Hello!")
input.onGesture(Gesture.Shake, () => {})
```
