This is the answer key for the [blink quiz](/lessons/blink/quiz).

## 1. Describe what `plot` does?

Answers will vary. In general, plot refers to the code that turns on a specific LED. We specify the LED using x, y coordinates.

## 2. Draw which LED is ON after running this code

```blocks
led.plot(2, 2)

```

By default, the position of an LED on *Blink Tutorial* is set to the centre of the screen. This code turns on the centre LED

## 3. Draw which LED is ON after running this code

```blocks
led.plot(0, 0)

```

This code turns on specific LED. Plot turns on the specified LED on the LED screen. We specify the LED using x, y coordinates.

* ``x`` - the x coordinate or horizontal position (0)
* ``y`` - the y coordinate or vertical position (0)

## 4. Draw which LED is ON after running this code

```blocks
led.plot(4, 4)

```

![](/static/mb/lessons/blink-2.png)

This code turns on specific LED. Plot turns on the specified LED on the LED screen. We specify the LED using ``x``, ``y`` coordinates.

* ``x`` - the x coordinate or horizontal position (4)
* ``y`` - the y coordinate or vertical position (4)
