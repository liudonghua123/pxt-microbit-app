## 1. Write the lines of code that takes the absolute value of the accelerations with respect to the x, y and z axis and stores the values as Local Variables

<br/>

<br/>

## 2. Write the lines of code that add all the accelerations together to get the total acceleration and stores the value as a Local Variable called "sum"

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

## 3. Write the 'If statement' used if the sum of the acceleration value is less than 1400 milli-gravitys. Then write the code that will plot an image of the fake amount of WiFi if the acceleration in this 'If statement'

<br/>

<br/>

## 4. Write tje 'If statement' used if the sum of the acceleration value is greater than 1400 milli-gravitys but less than 1680 milli-gravitys. Then write the code that will plot an image of the fake amount of WiFi inside this 'If statement'

<br/>

<br/>

## 5. Write the 'if statement' needed to display this specific plot image on the device
