# looper quiz answers

Learn how to create a series of numbers with a for loop.

This is the answer key for the [looper quiz](/lessons/looper/quiz).

## 1. What is a for loop?

Answers will vary. In general, for loop refers to the code that repeats for a fixed number of times. We specify the LED using x, y coordinates.

## 2. Consider the following code

```blocks
for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    basic.showNumber(i, 150)
}
```

If the rectangle below represents the @boardname@, shade the areas that will be displayed. Explain why that particular area is shaded.

Let's create a for loop where `0` is the loop's starting value, `i` is the index variable, and `4` is the ending value. The index variable `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 each time through the loop. The loop ends when `i = 4`.

## 3. Consider the following code

```blocks
for (let i1 = 0; i1 < 6; i1++) {
    basic.showNumber(i1, 150)
}
```

If the rectangle below represents the @boardname@, shade the areas that will be displayed. Explain why that particular area is shaded.

Let's create a for loop where `0` is the loop's starting value, `i` is the index variable, and `6` is the ending value. The index variable `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 each time through the loop. The loop ends when `i = 6`.
