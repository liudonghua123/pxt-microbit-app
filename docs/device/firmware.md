# Firmware

Occasionally, changes and improvements to the system software (firmware) on the @boardname@ are needed. Updates to the firmware are made by the [micro:bit Education Foundation](http://microbit.org/about).

## Do I need an update?

Changes to the firmware don't happen very often. You probably don't need to update it for your @boardname@ if everything is working alright. Sometimes there's a problem with a certain part of the board not working right or it has trouble connecting to your computer or other device. In those cases, a firmware update may include a fix for the problem.

## Getting a firmware update

Instructions for updating the firmware are shown on the **[firmware upgrade](https://microbit.org/guide/firmware/)** support page at microbit.org.
