### Level 2 (Grades 6-8)

#### Computing Systems
* 02 — Design projects that combine hardware and software components to collect and exchange data.
* 03 — Systematically identify and fix problems with computing devices and their components.

### Data and Analysis

* 07 — Represent data using multiple encoding schemes.
* 08 — Collect data using computational tools and transform the data to make it more useful and reliable.
* 09  — Refine computational models based on the data they have generated.

#### Algorithms & Programming

* 12 — Design and iteratively develop programs that combine control structures, including nested loops and compound conditionals.
* 13 — Decompose problems and subproblems into parts to facilitate the design, implementation, and review of programs.
* 17 — Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases.
* 19 — Document programs in order to make them easier to follow, test, and debug.

### Strand 6.4: Stability and Change in Ecosystems

The study of ecosystems includes the interaction of organisms with each other and with the physical environment. ... ecosystems benefit humans through processes and resources, such as the production of food, **water** and air purification...

* Standard 6.4.1

>Analyze data to provide evidence for the effects of resource availability on organisms and populations in an ecosystem. Ask questions to predict how changes in resource availability affects organisms in those ecosystems. Examples could include **water**, food, and living space in Utah environments.

* Standard 6.4.5

>Evaluate competing design solutions for preserving ecosystem services ...resources specific to Utah, such as air and **water quality** and prevention of **soil erosion**.

### Strand 7.1: Forces are Interactions between Matter

* Standard 7.1.3

>Construct a model using ...the cause and effect **relationship between properties** of objects (such as ...**electrically-charged objects**)....

* Standard 7.1.4

>Collect and analyze data to determine the factors that affect the **strength of electric** ... **forces**...

### Strand 8.2: Energy is Stored and Transferred in Physical Systems

* Standard 8.2.6

>Obtain and evaluate information to communicate the claim that the structure of **digital signals are a more reliable** way to store or transmit information than **analog signals**. Emphasize the basic understanding that waves can be used for communication purposes. Examples could include using vinyl record vs. digital song files, film cameras vs. digital cameras, or alcohol thermometers vs. digital thermometers.
