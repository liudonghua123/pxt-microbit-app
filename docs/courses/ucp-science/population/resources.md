### Level 2 (Grades 6-8)

#### Computing Systems

* 02 — Design projects that combine hardware and software components to collect and exchange data.
* 03 — Systematically identify and fix problems with computing devices and their components.

#### Data & Analysis

* 07 — Represent data using multiple encoding schemes.
* 08 — Collect data using computational tools and transform the data to make it more useful and reliable.
* 09  — Refine computational models based on the data they have generated.

#### Algorithms & Programming

* 11 — Create clearly named variables that represent different data types and perform operations on their values.
* 13 — Decompose problems and subproblems into parts to facilitate the design, implementation, and review of programs.
* 17 — Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases.
* 19 — Document programs in order to make them easier to follow, test, and debug.
