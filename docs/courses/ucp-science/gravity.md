Gravity is the attraction of one particle or body to another. Larger masses have a stronger gravitational force, or the measurement of the pull of gravity, than smaller masses. The @boardname@ can sense acceleration and can measure the force of motion. This lesson measures forces of motion with one @boardname@ and sends the data to a recording @boardname@. The experiment provides a basis for further force measurement activities.
