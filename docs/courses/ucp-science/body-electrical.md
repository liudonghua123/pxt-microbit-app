Electrical impulses in the body can be observed, measured, and recorded as waves to show that there is a relationship between the circulatory, respiratory, muscular, and nervous systems. The @boardname@ can measure and record these waves, then send them to a to another @boardname@ which serves as the data collection device. The data can then be downloaded and anaylzed in a spreadsheet.
