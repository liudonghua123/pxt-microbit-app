# Spoon Race

The egg-and-spoon race was first invented in 1894 in England where it was part of local village celebrations and picnics (alongside tug-of-war and wheelbarrow races). Competitors race with an uncooked egg balanced on a spoon. The objective is to get the finish line first without dropping the egg.

In this lesson, students will use the micro:bit in place of an egg, and collect data on the movement of the micro:bit during the race to determine a winner.
