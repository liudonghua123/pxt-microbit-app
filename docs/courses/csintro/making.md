## Lesson objectives 
Students will...

* Exercise creativity and resourcefulness by coming up with ideas for using simple household materials to accommodate the micro:bit’s size and weight in many different ways.
* Test and iterate using different materials and sizes in order to create an optimal design to house the micro:bit and battery pack
* Learn how to download programs and move them to the micro:bit file to run on the micro:bit.
* Use the design thinking process to develop an understanding for a problem or user need.
* Apply their understanding in a creative way by making a “micro:pet” creature.
