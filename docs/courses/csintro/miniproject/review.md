Take this time to review the concepts we have covered so far.

## Making

The micro:bit is very effective at bringing real things to life. It can be supported in a cardboard holder, attached to a wand, or even sewn into fabric. The design thinking process is a helpful way to gather more information about the person who will be using whatever you are designing.

## Processing and algorithms

The code you write for the micro:bit processes data from its inputs, and outputs it in some way. An algorithm is a series of specific instructions, or steps, that solve a problem or accomplish a task.

## Variables

Variables store information so that it can be accessed or referenced later. Some variables hold information that changes, and some hold information that stays constant. It is important to name your variables with something that explains what type of information it holds. Using variables in your code allows you to create algorithms that use mathematical operations to perform the same calculations every time, even when the values of your variables are different.

## Conditionals

Conditional statements tell the computer when to do something. They are used to create branches, or decision points, where a program can choose one path or the other based on the values of certain variables, or based on data from the micro:bitâ€™s inputs. Conditional statements can be nested inside one another so that both conditions must be true in order for the enclosed statements to run.

## Iteration and looping

Portions of your code can be made to run over and over by using a Repeat or a For block loop. This allows you to iterate over several different variables, or items in a group, and do something to each of them. You can also combine a conditional statement and a loop by using a While block, which will repeat until a certain condition becomes true.
