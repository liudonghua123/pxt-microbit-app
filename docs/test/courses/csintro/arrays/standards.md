## CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards

* CT.L1:6-02 Develop a simple understanding of an algorithm using computer-free exercise.
* CPP.L1:6-05 Construct a program as a set of step-by-step instructions to be acted out.
* 2-A-2-1 Solicit and integrate peer feedback as appropriate to develop or refine a program.
* 2-A-6-10 Use an iterative design process (e.g., define the problem, generate ideas, build, test, and improve solutions) to solve problems, both independently and collaboratively.
