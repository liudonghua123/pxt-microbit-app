# Introduction

The micro:bit allows you to communicate with other micro:bits in the area using the blocks in the Radio category. You can send a number, a string (a word or series of characters) or a string/number combination in a radio packet. You can also give a micro:bit instructions on what to do when it receives a radio packet.

The project for this lesson will challenge you to send and receive some sort of data to and from a pair of micro:bits. There is a wide range of simple and complex projects you can try, but whatever you choose, it is a whole lot of fun to communicate using the micro:bits!
