# Radio and Communication

![Combo Box Example](/static/courses/csintro/radio/combo-box.png)

This lesson covers the use of more than one micro:bit to share and combine data. You will send and receive numbers and strings in a series of guided activities, then create a project that makes use of the micro:bit's powerful Radio blocks.

**Please note that this lesson is centered around the micro:bit's communication capabilities, so testing the code in this lesson will require two micro:bits.**

## Lesson objectives

You will...
* Understand how to use the Radio blocks to send and receive data between micro:bits
* Understand the specific types of data that can be sent over the Radio

## Lesson structure

* Introduction: Radio & communication
