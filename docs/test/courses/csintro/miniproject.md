# Mini-project

![Ideas](/static/courses/csintro/miniproject/problem-solving.png)

In this unit, we’re going to review the stuff we’ve covered over the past few weeks, and give you some ideas for an independent “mini-project” that you’ll work on in the next few sessions. We’ll also show you a framework to help you stay on track with your work and give you some structure to guide your progress.

This project is designed to remind you that how you solve problems is just as important as getting the right answer. Programming is all about being patient and working through challenges, and it's really important to recognize and reward the effort and thinking you put into solving problems—not just whether you got it right!
