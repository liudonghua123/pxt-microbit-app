# Conditional statements

![Board game example](/static/courses/csintro/conditionals/cover.jpg)

This unit introduces the Logic blocks, such as ‘If…then’ and ‘If…then…else’. You will learn what **conditional** statements are, and why and when to use them in a program, practicing skills of creativity, problem solving, and collaboration in the process. You will code a game of “Rock, paper, scissors” with the micro:bit via the programmable buttons and the LED screen. In the final project, you'll be designing, building, and coding your own unique micro:bit-based board game using conditionals.

## Lesson objectives
You will...

* Understand what conditional statements are, and why and when to use them in a program.
* Learn how to use the Logic blocks 'If...then' and 'If…then...else'.
* Practice using the Logic blocks so different conditions yield specified outcomes.
* Demonstrate understanding and apply skill by creating a game that uses a micro:bit and a program that correctly and effectively uses conditionals.
