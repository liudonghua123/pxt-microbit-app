# Algorithms

This unit introduces the four main components that make up a computer and the concept of **input** and **output** as it relates to programming the micro:bit. The coding activity starts with an explanation of pseudocode that leads to working with events and event handlers to program your micro:bit to make faces. The project incorporates all the new learning from this unit as you create your own fidget cube that responds to different inputs.

## Lesson objectives
You will...

* Understand the functions of the four components that make up a computer.
* Understand that the micro:bit takes input, and after processing the input, produces output.
* Learn the variety of different types of information the micro:bit takes in as input.
* Apply this knowledge by creating a micro:bit program that takes input and produces an output.
